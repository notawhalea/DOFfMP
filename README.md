Development of Software for Mobile Platforms BSUIR(РПОдМП БГУИР 6 сем)

It's my *vision* in some task.
**********
**What I've done**:question:

In this repository you can find my solution of five labs.
**********
**FIRST LAB**:one:

**NOTEBOOK**:notebook:

Here i developed an application with a graphical user interface that supports the creation/editing/deleting/search of notes.

SQLite:pencil: database is used to store notes.

**How it's look like**

**SECOND LAB**:two:

**RSS-READER**:page_facing_up:

It is required to develop an application with a graphical interface that supports viewing any rss feed. It is necessary to implement parsing xml and displaying a list of news and also displaying the news in detail using UIWebView (that is, the page will open in the application, not the browser)

You can download a news feed both from a file and from the Internet.

**How it's look like**

I just relax and gained experience here.

Still in progress? Convert to draft!:wink:
